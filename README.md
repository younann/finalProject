# Final Project for DevSecOps Course

Welcome to the final project for the DevSecOps course! This project aims to integrate development, security, and operations practices to create a seamless workflow that enhances software delivery while ensuring security at every stage.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will demonstrate how to implement DevSecOps principles by automating security checks, integrating security tools into the CI/CD pipeline, and fostering a culture of security awareness among team members.

## Key Features

- **Automated Security Testing**: Incorporate tools that automatically test for vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline that includes security checks at every stage.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement monitoring solutions to track application performance and security incidents.
- **Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between development, security, and operations teams to ensure security is a shared responsibility.

## Features

- **Python Web Application**: A secure web application built using modern Python practices
- **Containerization**: Docker configuration for consistent deployment environments
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- **Security Controls**: Built-in security measures and best practices
- **CI/CD Integration**: Ready-to-use pipeline configurations

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up Local Development Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   python -m app.main
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## Docker Support

Build and run the application using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t python-devsecops .
docker run -p 8000:8000 python-devsecops
```

## Terraform script
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```
Verify the deployment

```bash
kubectl get pods -n default
```
